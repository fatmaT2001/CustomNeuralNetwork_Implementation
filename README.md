# CustomNeuralNetwork_Implementation
Explore neural network fundamentals with this Python-based implementation from scratch. The project includes building custom input, hidden, and output layers, activation functions, and one-hot encoding. Ideal for hands-on learning of neural network architecture and practical applications in data science.

# Custom Neural Network Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook titled "NeuralNetworkFromScratch", which is a comprehensive guide to building a neural network from the ground up in Python. The notebook meticulously covers each step of the neural network creation process, demonstrating the implementation of different layers, activation functions, and encoding techniques.

## Key Features
- Detailed implementation of input, hidden, and output layers tailored to input-output shapes.
- Custom functions for one-hot encoding of class labels.
- Implementation of popular activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid.
- Application of neural network concepts on real-world datasets, including MNIST and Iris.
- Usage of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Keras, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and model building.

## Prerequisites
